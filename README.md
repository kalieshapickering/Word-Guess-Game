# JavaScript Word Guess Game

### Overview

I have created a HTML/CSS Word Guess Browser Game that uses JavaScript to compose the logic and jQuery for DOM manipulation.

### Before You Begin

* Please note that I was unable to get the page to insert a new question after the original question was anwered. I have added a reload button in the interm till I can get that feature up and running! (Stay tune! :boom: )

### About The Game

I have created a trap style word guess game, what does `'trap'` mean? Trap is a style of music that distinguishes it self by its sound by using `'hi-hats'`. With this game, once you guess the correct letters of the selected Trap Music Artist one of `my favourite` songs from the artist will begin to play, so sit back and enjoy the music! :smile:

### Game Instructions

1. Press `any key` on the keyboard to `start` the game.
2. You have `16 guesses` to guess correct.
3. If you guess them all correct, sit back and enjoy the music! If not, press the play again button on the page and try again!
4. Press the `'play again?'`button to play again!
